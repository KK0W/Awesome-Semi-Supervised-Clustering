# Awesome-Semi-Supervised-Clustering


This repository contains a list of resources related to semi-supervised clustering. Semi-supervised clustering is a type of clustering where some labels (or a partial set) are available, in addition to the data. The goal is to leverage these labels, along with the data, to perform better clustering. The problem is not well understood, and there are a variety of approaches to solve semi-supervised clustering.
